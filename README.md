# pets
An university project dedicated to C# standart containers
Text file input.txt contains lines with info about one pet which have 4 fields:
 owner name (identically declare owner);
 animal species (cat, dog, etc);
 name (could be nameless);
 age in years.
Equal lines are allowed (10 same nameless fishes).
All fields are separated by commas, namelessness is matched by two commas written in a row. You have to:
 read file contents and write it to one or more containers, mostly suitable for this task in your opinion;
 and give answers for following questions:
1. Count number of different pet species every owner has.
2. Write all owners and names for current species (requested by user).
There will not be repeats among owners and names.
3. Determine, how many pets have current name (requested by user).
4. Write info about min and max age of every species.
Request realisation would be implemented through the menu. 
Situation, when user requests absent information would be foreseen.
